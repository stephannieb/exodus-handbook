# Our Purpose, Mission & Values üíé

## Our Purpose

Our purpose is the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù in what we do. What is our ‚Äúwhy‚Äù? Our fundamental, shared belief is that people have a right to control their wealth.


*The purpose of Exodus is to revolutionize the financial system.*


The blockchain, for the first time in history, has created a movement to shift power back to the people to manage their own assets - with no banks, no brokers, and no institutional oversight. We created Exodus for these visionaries, explorers departing the legacy system to protect and create wealth for future generations.

## *Our Mission*

By 2030, half of the planet will Exodus the traditional financial system.

## *Our Values*

As a customer-centric company, we deliver high value to our users, and our employees are simultaneously fulfilled. The customer experience takes the forefront and is the driving force behind nearly all of our business decisions. Internally, we follow a set of strong values that bring us together in our mission of driving the company forward.

We encourage everyone to show up as the best version of themselves and always set the bar high for each other. Exodus' NEW culture values are:

_Delivery._

We take ownership of deliverables and always provide outstanding execution. We dont wait around for direction and consider ourselves to be intrinsically motivated by the mission of the company. We value those who take action to solve problems, seek advice, and have a naturally curious mind.

_Customer Advocacy._

We go above and beyond to improve the experience of our customers, candidates and employees. We put ourselves in the shoes of the people we interact with, and this allows to not only better understand their needs, but exceed their expectations. We know they are putting their money in our care, and we are commited to take the best care of it, and them in the process.

_Always Candid._

We are willing to question the status quo and give meaningful, honest feedback. When providing feedback, we are thoughtful, compassionate and always give the other person the benefit of the doubt. Because we keep integrity at the forefront of everything we do, being transparent with one another is incredibly important.

_Commitment to help._

We are dedicated to our colleagues success as much as ours. We believe in the power of team work and never hold back to ask for help or seek feedback. Our philosophy here is that we would much prefer working together and helping eachother out than having one single expert work on a project alone.
